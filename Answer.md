1 Answer - The "Product" entity has a many-to-one relationship with the "Product_Category" entity. 
This means that each "Product" entity can only belong to one "Product_Category" entity, but each "Product_Category" 
entity can have many "Product" entities. The relationship is defined by the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, 
which references the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table.

2 Answer - You could ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it by adding a 
foreign key constraint to the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. This would prevent any products from being inserted or updated with an invalid category ID.

ALTER TABLE Product ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Product_Category FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Product_Category (id);
You could also add a check constraint to the "category_id" column to ensure that it always contains a valid category ID.

ALTER TABLE Product ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_Product_Category CHECK (category_id IN (SELECT id FROM Product_Category));
Finally, you could create a trigger on the "Product" table to automatically set the "category_id" column to a valid value if it is null or invalid.

CREATE TRIGGER Product_EnsureValidCategory
ON Product
FOR INSERT, UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
  IF NEW.category_id IS NULL OR NEW.category_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM Product_Category)
  THEN
    NEW.category_id = (SELECT id FROM Product_Category ORDER BY id LIMIT 1);
  END IF;
END;
